1. ReadyToRun() when a thread is ready, this function will decide how to place it into ready queue. Mark a thread as ready, but not running. Put it on the ready list, for later scheduling onto the CPU.
2. FindNextToRun() this function decides how to pick one thread to run from the ready queue.
3. ShouldISwitch() decides whether the running thread should preemptively give up to a new forked thread. This function uses the policy information to tell a thread::fork to preempt the current thread or to not.  The answer is the domain of the scheduler, so it is a member function call.
